    <h1>The Creative Artistry of: Dan R. Wright</h1>
    
<img src="http://placekitten.com/300/300"  class="images"/>
    <p>Dan Wright, an accomplished artist long before his formal traning, graduated from Washington State University with a B.S. in Education.  In pursuing his love of art, he has also studied in Hawaii, Cananda, New York and Colorado.</p>
    <p>Dan's unique approach to his subject matter is well recognized when viewing the diversification of his face sculptures to his Christmas nudes.  Dan uses light to enhance all his subject art. "Light," he says, "is a natural vehicle, and should penetrate and intensify the work, not just reflect off the surface."  Dan creates his own medium many times using such unusual means as miller moths, egg cartons or teeth.  Dan is also an accomplished greeting card cartoonish, and has also worked as a graphic artist producing a T-Shirt line.</p>
    <p>Dan's work is representative of his multi-dimensional levels of experience.  His work is sometimes impressionistic: a subtle departure from realism, inviting the viewer to become involved using their own imagination.</p>
    <p>Among Dan's life's experience, you would find him teaching such subjects as Architectural Design, Business Math, French, Spanish, or P.E.  He has taught scuba-diving, been a Lifeguard, and a Spa Instructor.  In addition, he has been a Stand-up Comedian, and Improv Comedy instructor, and Electro-static Engineer, Sales-manager, Graphic artist for an NFL &amp; MLB product, and a veteran Bunjie Jumper!  He speaks 12 different dialects, and has been active in the "Humor Movement!!"  He <strong>LIVES</strong> life, <strong>GIVE TO</strong> life, and creates laughter all around him. His sense of humor is evident in many of the art piece he creates.  They created a "happy and positive" experience for the viewer, as a result.</p>
    <p>Dan presently resides in Denver, Colorado, and is "reaching new heights within his own expectations for himself, and in the world of art."</p>
