                <h2>CINEBITES</h2>
                <p><img src="/image/cinebites_logo.jpg" alt="Cinebites" class="floatLeftBio">CINEBITES is an annual Film Festival held in Denver, CO. We showcase short films from around the world.</p>
                <p>Since 2009 the festival has been a platform for independent filmmakers to network and share their work with the community. The festival functions as a fundraiser for the non-profit Arts Street (<a href="http://www.arts-street.org" target="_blank">arts-street.org</a>). Films are curated by members of the Arts Street Alumni Association who strive to exhibit great short films from many genres.  Our festival director, Matt Struck (see bio below) has since moved from Denver to New York &amp; with his tremendous involvement with Cinebites and the connections he's obtained, we've decided to showcase Cinebites in New York in addition to still showcasing Cinebites in Denver.</p> 
                <p>Email one of our friendly organizers if you have any questions or would like to get involved.</p>

                <p>Arts Street started in 1999 as a non-profit youth program in Denver that creates opportunities for the young people of Colordao.  The opportunities provided are designed to foster the inspiration and education of these youth to become tomorrow's professionals and supporting the workforce needs.  This is achieved by developing and implementing highly diversified career-based, educational programs that incorporate real world learning, artistic expression and creative thinking.</p>
                <p>For more information about Arts Street, please visit their website at <a href="http://www.arts-street.org" target="_blank">www.arts-street.org</a>.

                <p>Profession: Supervisor &amp; Projectionist, Landmark Sunshine, (New York, NY)</p>
                <p>Matt took an early interest in filmmaking and editing. Around the age of 13 he got his first mini dv camera and he set out with group of friends to make a movie. After 6 months of writing, bad acting, and editing they all came together to screen their epic 20 minute film. Since then, Matt still finds incredible value and joy in independent films. He has worked as a filmmaker, editor, projectionist, and has been involved with different film festivals since 2008. He is currently living in New York and spreading the good word of Cinebites as we speak!</p>
